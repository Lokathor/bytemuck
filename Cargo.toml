[features]
# In v2 we'll fix these names to be more "normal".

# Enable deriving the various `bytemuck` traits.
derive = ["bytemuck_derive"]
# Enable features requiring items from `extern crate alloc`.
extern_crate_alloc = []
# Enable features requiring items from `extern crate std`.
extern_crate_std = ["extern_crate_alloc"]
# Implement `Zeroable` for `MaybeUninit`.
zeroable_maybe_uninit = []
# Implement `Zeroable` for `std::sync::atomic` types.
zeroable_atomics = []

# All MSRV notes below are GUIDELINES and future versions may require even more
# MSRV on any feature.

# MSRV 1.36: Use `align_offset` method instead of casting to `usize` to check
# alignment of pointers, this *may* improve codegen in some cases (but it has
# never been formally benchmarked!)
align_offset = []

min_const_generics = [] # MSRV 1.51: support arrays via min_const_generics

wasm_simd = []    # MSRV 1.54.0: support wasm simd types
aarch64_simd = [] # MSRV 1.59.0: support aarch64 simd types

must_cast = [] # MSRV 1.64.0: support the `must` module.

# Adds `TransparentWrapper` impls for stdlib types newer than bytemuck's base MSRV.
# Current MSRV 1.74.0: `core::num::Saturating`.
# MSRV may increase if impls are added for newer types.
transparentwrapper_extra = []

const_zeroed = [] # MSRV 1.75.0: support const `zeroed()`

# Do not use if you can avoid it, because this is **unsound**!!!!
unsound_ptr_pod_impl = []

# MSRV 1.46.0: adds the `#[track_caller]` attribute to functions which may panic
track_caller = []

# Enables all features that are both sound and supported on the latest stable
# version of Rust, with the exception of `extern_crate_alloc` and
# `extern_crate_std`.
# Note: Enabling this feature opts out of any MSRV guarantees!
