//! This crate gives small utilities for casting between plain data types.
//!
//! ## Basics
//!
//! Data comes in five basic forms in Rust, so we have five basic casting
//! functions:
//!
//! * `T` uses [`cast`]
//! * `&T` uses [`cast_ref`]
//! * `&mut T` uses [`cast_mut`]
//! * `&[T]` uses [`cast_slice`]
//! * `&mut [T]` uses [`cast_slice_mut`]
//!
//! Some casts will never fail (eg: `cast::<u32, f32>` always works), other
//! casts might fail (eg: `cast_ref::<[u8; 4], u32>` will fail if the reference
//! isn't already aligned to 4). Each casting function has a "try" version which
//! will return a `Result`, and the "normal" version which will simply panic on
//! invalid input.
//!
//! ## Using Your Own Types
//!
//! All the functions here are guarded by the [`Pod`] trait, which is a
//! sub-trait of the [`Zeroable`] trait.
//!
//! If you're very sure that your type is eligible, you can implement those
//! traits for your type and then they'll have full casting support. However,
//! these traits are `unsafe`, and you should carefully read the requirements
//! before adding the them to your own types.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * This crate is core only by default, but if you're using Rust 1.36 or later
//!   you can enable the `extern_crate_alloc` cargo feature for some additional
//!   methods related to `Box` and `Vec`. Note that the `docs.rs` documentation
//!   is always built with `extern_crate_alloc` cargo feature enabled.
